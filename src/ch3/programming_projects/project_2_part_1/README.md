Problem Notes.
===


Write kernel module, in given Linux VM, like in chapter 2, to list all tasks(= processes) in the system.


From section 3.1:



![](imgs/img3.png)


* What is the full file path of <linux/sched.h> ?


* /usr/src/linux-headers-3.16.0-4-common/include/linux/sched.h


The definition of `struct task_struct` can be found by searching for `struct task_struct {`.


It spans 434 lines! The structure members of interest are: name, state, pid:


Name:

State:

PID:

* Where is for_each_process() defined?


* Same file as `tast_struct` <linux/sched.h>:

Solution Plan.
===


Start with the simple kernel module from chapter 2.


Modify it to iterate over all tasks using for_each_process(). Print: name, state, pid.


Do print inside module entry point, print to kernel log buffer.


Use `dmesg` to view programâ€™s output. Compare to output of `ps -el`. The output will be mostly the same, but not identical since tasks come and go dynamically.


We will need to know how to read the output of the `ps -el` command, here is an example of its output:



![](imgs/img8.png)


The columns of interest are: S, PID, CMD


The S values is defined here:

Solution Test Cases.
===


The output of my program is in `simple.c_output.txt`.


The output of the `ps` command is in `ps_-el_output.txt`.


Solution Description and Results.
===


On a VirtualBox VM running Debian Linux version 3.16.0-4,


To compile: `make`  [See given Makefile.]


To run/insert the kernel module :


`insmod simple.ko` // If you get an error use `su -` first.


To view the output in the kernel log buffer.


`dmesg`


To verify the output:


`ps -el`


To remove the kernel module:


`rmmod simple`


End.
